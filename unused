                        Our Science Mastery Program for students in Years 1-12 focuses on transforming our learners into science whiz and feeding their curiosity about the world.
    
                        For our younger learners in Years 1-6, we focus on creating a strong foundation in basic scientific principles, with topics ranging from life processes, materials, and physical forces. Our program encourages curiosity, experimentation, and observation.
    
                        As our students advance to Year 10, we delve deeper into the science of biology, physics, and chemistry. We cover complex topics such as genetics, quantum mechanics, and chemical reactions, and even touch on specialized subjects like environmental science and astronomy.
    
                        We're about making science less of a school subject and more of a fascinating journey.
